# Seasoning Meat Before Grilling

- Season the meat with 1/4 tsp of salt per 150g of meat. For fish, adjust the seasoning based on the saltiness.
- Season the meat with salt 1 hour before grilling and pat dry right before cooking, or season with salt 3-4 minutes before grilling. This is advantageous for creating a crust.
